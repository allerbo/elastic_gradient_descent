## Figure 1:
```
python diff_demo.py              #Uses elastic_desc.py.
```

## Figures 2, 3 and 4:
```
bash sweep_synth.sh              #Calls run_exps.py
python plot_rho_sweep.py         #Creates figures from data generated by run_exps.py
```

## Table 1:
```
bash sweep_real.sh              #Calls run_exps.py
```

## Figure 5
```
python diab_paths_zoom.py        #Uses elastic_desc.py.
```

## Figure 6
```
python diab_paths_grad.py        #Uses coord_desc.py, elastic_desc.py and elastic_flow.py
```

## Figure 7
```
python diab_path_flavs.py        #Uses elastic_desc.py.
```
